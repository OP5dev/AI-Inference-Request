# Security Policy

> [!TIP]
>
> Pin your GitHub Action to a [commit SHA](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions "Security hardening for GitHub Actions.") to harden your CI/CD pipeline security against supply chain attacks.

Integrating security in your CI/CD pipeline is critical to practicing DevSecOps. This action aims to be secure by default, and it should be complemented with your own review to ensure it meets your (organization's) security requirements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
